# OSK.Unity3D.NetCollections
This project is meant to serve as a simple to use container system that is entirely based upon the standard .NET service collection extensions. Using this as the basis for the DI system will allow for any packages within the .NET ecosystem to be integrated into a game application. Nuget packages can be added to a project using a mechanism such as [NuGetForUnity](https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity)

#Add Package to Unity3D:
